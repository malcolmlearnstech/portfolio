          As is often the case with ultra, that period of pain and deep
          exhaustion was chased by an extended flow state. Toward the end of his
          13th lap, he hit top gear. Rocking to playlists he had curated for the
          occasion, he sang aloud as he ran. His 91st mile was his fastest:
          6:43. His 19th and final loop was his victory lap. “I told the guys,
          were going to finish the way we started: strong. And I just went for
          it.” He ran, all out, often with his eyes closed. It was up to his
          pacers to make sure he stayed on course, and they did. When he reached
          Engineers Gate for the final time just before midnight on Friday,
          after running a total of 19 loops and 116 miles, he fell to the
          ground, elated yet spent.
